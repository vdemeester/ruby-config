* Ruby configuration

   I don't really use [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/][Ruby]] that much but when I need to work on a Ruby project
   I want to have a decent configuration.

   Tell Emacs rake, bundler files and =*.erb= are Ruby files.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (dolist (exp '("Rakefile\\'" "\\.rake\\'" "Gemfile\\'" "\\.erb\\'"))
       (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
                    (cons exp 'ruby-mode)))
   #+END_SRC
